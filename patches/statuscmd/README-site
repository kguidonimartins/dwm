statuscmd
Description
This patch adds the ability to execute shell commands based on the mouse
button and position when clicking the status bar.
Usage
Fill 'statuscmds' with commands. Choose which command to run by prefixing
the status text with a raw byte of the command's index in 'statuscmds',
offset by +1 since '\0' terminates strings. statuscmds[0] runs by default
if there is no index to the left of the mouse position. The mouse button
clicked is exported as $BUTTON.
Example
With these commands:
static const char *statuscmds[] = { "volume", "cpu", "battery" };
And root name set like this:
xsetroot -name "$(echo -e 'volume |\x02 cpu |\x03 battery')"
Clicking on 'volume |' would run volume, clicking on ' cpu |'
would run cpu and clicking on ' battery' would run battery.
The cpu script could look like this:
#!/bin/sh
case $BUTTON in
	1) notify-send "CPU usage" "$(ps axch -o cmd,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head)";;
	3) st -e htop;;
esac
Notes
If you have 10 or more commands, make sure to be careful when adding or
removing newline characters since '\n' is equal to '\x0a'. The problem
where having certain unprintable characters such as '\n' in the status
string can make dwm laggy is "fixed", since they are not copied to the
string that is actually drawn.
dwmblocks integration
A program that sets the status for dwm such as
dwmblocks can be patched to manage
the commands while dwm only finds the location clicked in the status bar.
This way, no changes are needed in dwm when adding or reordering modules.
Instead of running a command from within dwm using the control character
as an index, the dwm-statuscmd-signal patch sends a SIGUSR1 signal to
dwmblocks with the button and control character encoded into the signal value.
The dwmblocks-statuscmd patch makes dwmblocks put each block's signal in
front of its output text and handles the SIGUSR1 signal by running the
block's command with $BUTTON exported.
