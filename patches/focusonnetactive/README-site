Description
By default, dwm response to client requests to _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client
messages by setting the urgency bit on the named window.
This patch activates the window instead.
Both behaviours are legitimate according to the
cursed spec
One should decide which of these one should perform based on the message
senders' untestable claims that it represents the end-user. Setting the urgency
bit is the conservative decision. This patch implements the more trusting
alternative.
It also allows dwm to work with wmctrl -a and other external window
management utilities.
