fullscreen compilation

Compilation of fullscreen patches for dwm.

This aims to provide a comprehensive fullscreen solution with the following features:

    toggle fullscreen for any window using a single keybinding rather than having to rely on per-application keybindings
    the ability to have windows go fullscreen within the size and position the window is currently in (a.k.a. fake fullscreen)
    allow a fullscreen window to be moved to an adjacent monitor while remaining fullscreen
    make fullscreen windows lose fullscreen if another (e.g. new) window on the same monitor receives focus, while still allowing dialog boxes to show while in fullscreen
    allow seamless transition between the two fullscreen modes

The default keybindings are:

    MOD+f to make a window fullscreen
    MOD+Shift+f to make a window fake fullscreen

This incorporates, and expands on, the following patches:

    fakefullscreenclient
    togglefullscreen (a.k.a. actualfullscreen)
    tagmonfixfs
    losefullscreen
